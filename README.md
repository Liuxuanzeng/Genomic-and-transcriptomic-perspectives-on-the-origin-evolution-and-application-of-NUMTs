The major codes in the analysis of Nuclear mitochondrial DNA fragments (NUMTs).

NUMT_blast_allmaker.py

To extract NUMT fragments, flanking 25bp, flanking 100bp, and flanking 2000bp sequences and calculate the GC content. Because mtDNA is a circular molecule, this code merged the NUMT fragments in the BLASTn result due to linear alignment.NUMT fragments, flanking 25bp, flanking 100bp, and flanking 2000bp sequences
